A client-side Othello game built as a Single Page Application using React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit ‚Äî designed for clarity, extensibility, and maintainability.

```cmd
üöÄ Quick Start
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173

# Tech Stack

Vite ‚Äì fast bundler
React + TypeScript ‚Äì type-safe
Redux Toolkit ‚Äì state management
ESLint + Prettier ‚Äì consistent, Unix-compliant formatting

# Thought process

1. chore: initialize Vite React TypeScript project

Started from a clean Vite template with React + TS.
Goal: keep the setup minimal and fully client-side (CSR only).
Configured initial project structure to separate app, lib, and ui concerns.

2. chore: add linebreak rules

Early step to ensure Unix compliance ‚Äî enforced LF endings, trailing newline, and clean diffs via ESLint

3. feat: added game engine

Implemented a pure TypeScript Othello engine inside lib/othello/core/.
The engine includes:

Board initialization
Move validation (including directional flipping)
Turn logic and scoring
Terminal detection

Thought process:

Keep engine pure and framework-agnostic so it can be reused in tests, AI, or even another UI framework.
Put all rules in a single place to avoid duplicated logic in Redux or UI layers.

4. refactor: clean up engines + extract types

After initial feature growth, extracted all type definitions into a dedicated types.ts.
This improved clarity and made the engine easier to extend (e.g., future variants, board size options).

Anticipated issue: coupling between engine and Redux types.
Solution: define GameState, Move, and Player at the core layer, then reference them everywhere else.

5. feat: added redux store + engine slice

Introduced Redux Toolkit for predictable state management.
The engineSlice manages:

Current game state
Integration with engine functions (init, step)
Undo/redo via snapshots

Thought process:

Treat the Redux slice like a ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù between UI and pure game logic.
Keep the reducer small and declarative by delegating heavy logic to engine helpers.
History handling was designed with future AI replays and game export in mind.

6. feat(ui): board + controls + score panel + uiSlice

Built the initial UI layer:
Board ‚Äì renders the grid and interactive squares
ScorePanel ‚Äì shows player scores and current turn
Controls ‚Äì reset/undo/redo buttons
uiSlice ‚Äì manages non-game UI state (visibility, hints, etc.)

Design choices:

Keep components dumb and driven by Redux selectors.
Avoid state duplication ‚Äî the single source of truth is always the store.
Used inline styles for MVP speed, but structure allows later theming or CSS modules.

7. feat(ui): added ui state selectors

Introduced selectors under ui/selectors/ to separate UI logic from components.
Selectors keep components minimal and make it easy to add derived values (like current player name or hint markers).

Anticipated issue: prop drilling and over-re-renders.
Solution: selectors + memoization keep updates efficient and composable.

8. feat(engine): game history with snapshots

Added a snapshot-based undo/redo system:
past, present, future stacks
Each move pushes a snapshot; undo/redo simply swaps states

Thought process:

Simple, predictable approach for MVP.
Chose full-state snapshots for reliability over performance; can later optimize with diffs or move lists.
This structure will also support ‚Äúreplay mode‚Äù or move analysis features later.

9. chore: use absolute paths

Finalized developer experience by enabling absolute imports with @app, @ui, @lib, @assets.
This improves readability and resilience during refactors.

# Possible evolutions:

Add a ‚Äúmove list‚Äù view for users.
Add save/load support via localStorage or replay files under lib/othello/infra/.
Store every ended game in DB
Add an AI player
Upload AI configuration
Replays/Game analysis for AI training
Multiplayer
Use redis for cache

## Development Journey

### 1. `chore: initialize Vite React TypeScript project`

Started from a clean Vite template with React + TS.  
Goal: keep the setup minimal and fully client-side (CSR only).  
Configured initial project structure to separate **app**, **lib**, and **ui** concerns.

---

### 2. `chore: add linebreak rules`

Early step to ensure **Unix compliance** ‚Äî enforced LF endings, trailing newline, and clean diffs via ESLint + `.editorconfig`.  
This keeps the project consistent across systems (especially important for CI or shared repos).

---

### 3. `feat: added game engine`

Implemented a **pure TypeScript Othello engine** inside `lib/othello/core/`.  
The engine includes:

- Board initialization
- Move validation (including directional flipping)
- Turn logic and scoring
- Terminal detection

> Thought process:
>
> - Keep engine **pure and framework-agnostic** so it can be reused in tests, AI, or even another UI framework.
> - Encapsulate all rules in a single place to avoid duplicated logic in Redux or UI layers.

### 4. `refactor: clean up engines + extract types`

After initial feature growth, extracted all **type definitions** into a dedicated `types.ts`.  
This improved clarity and made the engine easier to extend (e.g., future variants, board size options).

> Anticipated issue: coupling between engine and Redux types.  
> Solution: define `GameState`, `Move`, and `Player` at the core layer, then reference them everywhere else.

## Future Ideas & Extensibility

- **AI Opponent:** plug-in strategy interface (`greedy`, `minimax`, etc.) in `lib/othello/core/ai/`.
- **Custom Variants:** change board size (6x6, 10x10), or add rule modifiers (corner bonus, time control).
- **Replay System:** export/import move history, visualize playback in `lib/othello/replays/`.
- **Persistence:** save and restore current games using `infra/storage.ts`.
- **Theme System:** light/dark mode toggle managed by `uiSlice`.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard navigation, ARIA-friendly board, screen reader hints.
- **Testing:** expand Vitest coverage for engine and slices.

---

## Possible Evolutions

### Add a ‚ÄúMove List‚Äù View

- **Idea:** Display all moves chronologically beside the board (e.g., `E6 ‚Üí F5 ‚Üí D3 ‚Ä¶`).
- **Why:** Helps users follow the game‚Äôs progression, debug AI decisions, and support analysis/replay features.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Extend the `gameSlice` to store `moveHistory` (array of `{move, player, timestamp}` objects).
  - Render it in a side panel or modal using `ui/components/MoveList.tsx`.
  - Integrate with undo/redo to stay in sync with current board state.

### Save/Load Support (LocalStorage or Replay Files)

- **Idea:** Allow saving current games to browser storage or exporting them as `.json` replays.
- **Why:** Enables users to pause/resume later, share games, or analyze past matches.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Create `lib/othello/infra/persistence.ts` with `saveGame()` and `loadGame()` utilities.
  - Save the minimal game state (board, turn, history) to `localStorage`.
  - Support file-based import/export under `lib/othello/replays/`.
  - Validate replays against engine rules on load.

### Store Every Ended Game in a Database

- **Idea:** Persist completed games (moves, scores, players) for analysis or leaderboards.
- **Why:** Useful for player statistics, AI training data, or tracking progress.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Add a small backend (e.g., NestJS + PostgreSQL) to collect results.
  - Use an API adapter under `lib/othello/infra/api.ts`.
  - Store `{gameId, moves, finalScore, duration, aiConfig}`.
  - Future: expose endpoints for filtering and replay retrieval.

### Add an AI Player

- **Idea:** Let users play against an automated opponent.
- **Why:** Adds engagement and demonstrates extensibility of the game engine.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Define a strategy interface in `lib/othello/core/ai/`.
  - Implement a simple `greedy` strategy first (max flips).
  - Use `useAiAutoMove()` React hook to trigger AI moves when its turn starts.
  - Support adjustable difficulty (delay, randomness, lookahead).

### Upload AI Configuration

- **Idea:** Allow importing/exporting AI profiles as JSON (weights, difficulty, etc.).
- **Why:** Enables experimentation and fine-tuning for AI behavior or learning.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Store configs under `lib/othello/ai/profiles/`.
  - Add a UI modal for uploading/downloading JSON config.
  - Merge uploaded parameters into AI logic dynamically at runtime.

### Replays & Game Analysis for AI Training

- **Idea:** Feed recorded games to a machine learning pipeline to train or evaluate AI models.
- **Why:** Lets the AI improve from past games, similar to reinforcement learning.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Export move history in a clean JSON format (input ‚Üí board, output ‚Üí move).
  - Build a replay parser under `lib/othello/replays/` to iterate through states.
  - Integrate with Python-based analysis scripts or external training pipelines.

### Multiplayer Mode

- **Idea:** Enable two players to play remotely.
- **Why:** Makes the game social and demonstrates client-server synchronization.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO or NestJS Gateway).
  - Keep all game logic client-side and sync only moves/events.
  - Add player session IDs and basic lobby/matchmaking logic.
  - Future: integrate chat or spectator mode.

### Use Redis for Cache

- **Idea:** Cache recent games, AI evaluations, or matchmaking data.
- **Why:** Reduces database load and speeds up multiplayer or replay features.
- **Implementation path:**
  - Cache heavy reads: replay summaries, AI training stats, leaderboards.
  - Store short-lived session/game snapshots for real-time play.
  - Pair with background workers to process AI results asynchronously.

---

## Long-Term Vision

By keeping the **engine pure** and **infrastructure decoupled**, this project can evolve from a simple local SPA into:

- A multiplayer Othello platform,
- With persistent accounts, leaderboards, and AI experimentation,
- While maintaining testable, modular TypeScript foundations.

---

## Summary

This project was built to demonstrate:

- Solid **architecture layering**
- Clean, **typed** logic separation
- Extensibility for new rules and features
- A clear **thought process** with consistent commits and documentation

The codebase is ready for future expansions (AI, replays, variants) while staying lightweight and maintainable.
